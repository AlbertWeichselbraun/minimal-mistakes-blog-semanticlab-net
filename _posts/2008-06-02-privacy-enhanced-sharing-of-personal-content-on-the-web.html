<p>by Mannan, Mohammad and van Oorschot, Paul</p>
<p>This article introduces a technique for sharing personal data based on the contact lists of instant messaging (IM) networks. Besides this idea the paper has the following intersting points:</p>
<ul>
<li>the authors note that storing <i>relationship information</i> and <i>user data</i> on the same site may undermine privacy!</li>
<li>they list a number of consequences of lost privacy including: (a) denying / loosing jobs, (b) suspending of students, (c) tracking of government agencies.
<li>removing content that may be deemed offensive or was posted in an emotional response is tricky (backups, facebook does not let you remove your birthday, etc.).
</ul></p>
