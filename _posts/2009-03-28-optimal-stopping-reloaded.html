<p><strong>On the use of hybrid reinforcement learning for autonomic resource allocation</strong> ***
by Teasuro et. al</p>
<p>This paper elaborates on the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for automatic resource allocation. Again the paper addresses the problem of translating high-level objectives into system actions, using a utility model, allowing systems to dynamically reconfigure themselves, optimize their performance, detect and repair faults, etc. [teasuro2007].</p>
<p>The paper provides the following contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>it discusses the difficulty of acquiring sufficient domain knowledge, required to create optimized strategies - the so called <b>knowledge bottleneck</b>.</li>
<li>lack of knowledge yields to poor performance during live online training conducted by reinforced training approaches - the paper addresses this problem by introducing a hybrid approach (the system is controlled using a fixed policy $$p_i$$, until the reinforced training approach learned a better conducting policy $$p_i'$$. This step of online learning and replacing strategies might even be iterated over time.</li>
<li>The show that their hybrid RL approach is promising for systems with:
<ul>
<li>tractable state-space representation</li>
<li>frequent online decision making depending upon time-varying system states</li>
<li>frequent observations of numerical rewards</li>
<li>pre-existing policies that obtain acceptable (but imperfect) performance levels</li>
   </ul>
 </li>
</ul></p>
<p>Addons: </p>
<ul>
<li>reinforced learning uses trial-and-error methods to learn the value function $$Q_{p_i}(s,a)$$ adjusting a value to action <b>a</b> performed in state <b>s</b>.
It has the following main advantages: (i) it does not need an explicit model of the domain, and (ii) it is grounded in Markov decision processes (mdp) theory which is fundamentally a sequential decision theory.
</li></p>
<li>Temporal Difference learning and related methods, combined with Bellman's policy improvement theorem shows that the policy will converge under stated conditions.</li>

<p><strong>Using economic models to allocate resources in database management systems</strong> ***
by Zhang et al.</p>
<p>This paper elaborates on a economic model to allocate <em>multiple resources</em> such as memory buffer space and CPU shares to workloads running on a DBMS. The authors apply a utility model to model the workload's utility based on business importance, reducing the potential complexity of the resource allocation problem.</p>
<p>The authors provide a good overview of related literature using concepts from microeconomics (Davison et al.) and economic models (Boughton et al.), and demonstrate how a broker based trade mechanism can be applied to this problem class.</p>
<ul>
<li>broker and consumers try to achieve their goals (maximize utility)</li>
<li>consumer (=workload) wealth is assigned in accordance to the workload's importance.
(more important workloads are wealthier and are therefore more likely to win auctions)</li></p>
<li>the use an easy model to capture the additional utility gained by another unit of a resource.
(resource res_j will be retrieved as long as $$du/dres_i \gt du/dres_j$$ for any $$j \ne i$$)
-> the model therefore manages to break down the very complex concept of utility to an easy representation</li></p>
<li>performance models show how CPU and memory buffer's are distributed</li>
<li>utility is given as a fraction of the maximum throughput</li>
</ul>
In conclusion the paper show that high-level business importance policies can be translated into resource tuning actions for a DBMS.</p>
