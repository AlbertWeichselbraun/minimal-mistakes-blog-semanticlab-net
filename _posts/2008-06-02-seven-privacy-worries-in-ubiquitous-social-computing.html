<p>Motahari et. al identify seven privacy threads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inappropriate use by administrators</li>
<li>legal obligations: e.g. police</li>
<li>inadequate security</li>
<li>design invasions (poor features): e.g. cell phone localizer</li>
<li>social inference through lack of entropie: campuswiki </li>
<li>social inference through persistent user observations</li>
<li>social leveraging of privileged data: A asks B; "additional" friends in social networks </li>
</ul></p>
<p>The authors show that users are more concerened about the threads they know (1-4), than over the (even more dangerous) last three points.</p>
