<p>Phd Thesis by Hamish Cunningham</p>
<p>The thesis makes the case for GATE - the General Architecture for Text Engineering - a framework propagating code reuse for language engineering software.
Most relevant for our work is chapter five, presenting several approaches towards annotating corpora. Embedded Markup, TIPSTER and LDC are introduced. Chapter six gives an overview over the GATE architecture (GATE 1.0 and an outlook on GATE 2.0 - both versions are outdated - currently GATE 4.0 is in beta stadium). Recent versions of GATE use ANNI to save annotations.</p>
