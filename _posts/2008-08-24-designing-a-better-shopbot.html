<p>This paper describes optimizing the design of a shopbot (=shopping robot) which considers,</p>
<ul>
<li>the intrinsic value of the product,</li>
<li>the disutility from waiting, and</li>
<li>the cognitive cost associated with evaluating the offers retrieved</li>
</ul></p>
<p><i>Note:</i>
The cost of evaluation refers to the cost of going through the list of offers (not of evaluating the offers themselves).</p>
<p>Considering these criteria the authors determine, whether the consumer maximizes his utility by,</p>
<ul>
<li>buying at his favourite store,</li>
<li>the agent, or</li>
<li>an optimized version of the agent.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Agent design</b>
Agent variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>stores to query, (waiting time)</li>
<li>response timeouts, and (waiting time)</li>
<li>which items to report (cognitive costs)</li>
</ul>
Reducing waiting and time and cognitive costs reduce the total utility of the returned items (offer set).</p>
<p>Query times: fat tails (10% of the queries time out after 3 minutes)
<b>Radom Utility Model</b>
The utility is composed of three parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utility of the product</li>
<li>Costs of the waiting time (query times) and processing time (time to spawn a thread)</li>
<li>Cognitive effort of evaluating the answer set</li>
</ul></p>
<p><i>Utility</i> is the sum of the utility provided by the attributes of the product and a stochastic component epsilon covering unobservable factors and random revaluation errors. This compensatory utility model allows considering the effect of multiple utility-factors on the total utility (and therefore for example considering trade-offs).
The authors use an extreme value distribution with a zero location parameter and a scale parameter theta.</p>
<p><i>Cognitive Costs</i> are estimated using a heuristic introduced by Shugan (1980):</p>
<p> C=(A-1)(P-1)</p>
<p><i>Waiting times</i> are modelled as exponentially distributed (page 196). A gamma distribution estimates the response time of requests (provided that the store responses(!)).</p>
<p>The paper also considers consumer heterogeneity and the resulting different assessment of the utility of a product.
Afterwards the authors split the decision process into two stages, describe the number of different combinations per stage and provide a solution for choosing an optimal strategy.</p>
<p><b>Literature</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Choice with uncertain sets</i> (the decision maker decides which alternatives to consider (for the decision) with imperfect information</li>
<li><i>Information Overload and Cognitive Costs<i>. Previous research shows, that consumers are willing to trade off cognitive effort for accuracy.</li>
<li><i>Usability studies</i>. Delay of more than 10 seconds yields a loss of user attention (Nielson 2000, p44); Users place high emphasis on download times (Udo and Marquis 2001).</li>
<li><i>Cost of waiting time</i>. Konana et al. (2000) show that there is a direct trade-off between waiting time and cost. Experiments by Dellaert and Kahn (1999) show that waiting negatively affects the evaluations of Web sites. </li>
  The authors assume a value of time of 0.01 $/seconds (based on a yearly wage of $70,000).
