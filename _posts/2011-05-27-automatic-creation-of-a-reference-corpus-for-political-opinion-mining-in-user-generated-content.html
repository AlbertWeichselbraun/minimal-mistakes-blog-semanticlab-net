<p>by Sarmento et al. (TSA 2009)</p>
<p>This article presents an approach which applies manually-crafted lexico-syntactic patterns to collect highly opinionated commends posted by users in a Portuguese online newpaper. Afterwards these comments are propagated to the other sentences in these comments.</p>
<p>The authors evaluate the initial corpus (sentences matching the lexico-syntactic patterns) by classifying them according to six different error categories. Afterwards they evaluate the accuracy of the extended corpus (including the other sentences in the reviews) according to a five category schema.</p>
<p>The evaluations show that propagating negative opinions is less problematic than the propagation of positive opinions since there is the danger of </p>
<ul>
<li>polarity inversion (the commend starts slightly positive but is followed by criticism)</li>
<li>irony</li>
</ul>
This is also reflected in the method's performance: the precision for negative opinions yields 90% in contrast to 60% for positive opinions.</p>
