<p>by Kleinberg (SIGMOD 2010 Keynode; kleinberg2010)</p>
<p>Kleinberg notes that to understand the dynamics of real-time information, we need on ways to</p>
<ul>
<li>reason about the flow of information between people in social networks and the mechanisms of social influence</li>
<li>identify relevant text, references and phrases</li>
</ul>
We also need to consider aggregated effects such as</p>
<ul>
<li>how word or topic clusters change over time [7,13,15,24,25] or</li>
<li>how to track units of text over time.</li>
</ul></p>
