<h2>Key Concepts</h2></p>
<ol>
<li>companies apply CI methods that</li>
<ul>
<li>monitor the reception of their own products and services</li>
<li>analyze information on their competitors activities</li>
</ul></p>
<li>comparative opinions are valuable information sources for identifying the relative weaknesses and strengths of products.</li>
<li>the authors  distinguish between rule-based relation extraction methods with automatically and manually defined rules. The first group is further separated into (i) feature-based methods, that rely on features such as POS tags and entity types for relation extraction, and (ii) kernel-based methods that represent examples and define kernels to compute similarities in a high-dimensional space.</li>
<li>comparative relation extraction obtains <strong>directed relation</strong> with the following <strong>four arguments</strong>:<em>
$$Relation Type and Direction(Product_1, Product_1, Attribute, Sentimental Phrase)$$</em></li></p>
<li>Examples relations:</li>
<ul>
<li>>(Nokia N95, iPhone, camera, better)</li>
<li>~(Pearl, Curve, camera, high resolution)</li>
<li> >(iPhone, Curve, screen, bigger</li>
</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Method</h2>
The authors use conditional random fields to model (a) the relation between relations and entities, and (b) between relations and words.</p>
<p><strong>Linguistic Features
</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Capitalization information (identify product names), Word type, POS tags</li>
<li>Prefixes and suffixes: recognize sentiment phrases (bett-er, quick-er, fast-est, ...)</li>
<li>Indicator phrases for comparisons (in contrast to, unlike, compare with, ...)</li>
<li>Syntactic paths (identify comparisons)</li>
<li>Grammatical roles (products are often subjects, attributes entities are objects, ...)</li>
</ol>
