<div>Damiani, E. et al., 2004. An Open Digest-based Technique for Spam Detection. In <i>in Proceedings of the 2004 International Workshop on Security in Parallel and Distributed Systems</i>. pp. 15&mdash;17.</div>

<h2>Summary</h2>
This paper discusses the Nilsimsa open digest hash algorithm which is frequently used for Spam detection. The authors describe the computation of the 32-byte code, discuss different attack scenarios and measures to counter them.</p>
<h2>Digest computation</h2></p>
<ol>
<li>slide a five character window through the input text and compute all eight possible tri-grams for each window (e.g. "igram" yields "igr", "gra", "ram", "ira", "iam", "grm",  ...)</li>
<li>hash these trigrams using a hash function <em>h() </em>which maps every tri-gram to one of 256 accumulators and increment the corresponding accumulator. Nilsimsa uses the Trans53 hash function for hashing.</li>
<li>at the end of the process described below, compute the <em>expected value</em> of the accumulators and set the bits which correspond to each accumulator either to (1) if it exceeds this threshold or (o) otherwise.</li>
</ol></p>
<h2>Similarity computation</h2>
The Nilsimsa similarity is computed based on the bitwise difference between two Nilsimsa hashes. Documents are considered similar if they exceed a pre-defined similarity value.</p>
<ol>
<li>>24 similar bits - conflict probability: 1.35E-4 (suggestions by Nilsimsa's original designer)</li>
<li>>54 similar bits - conflict probability: 7.39E-12 (suggested by the article's authors)</li>
</ol></p>
<h2>Attacks</h2>
Spammers can apply multiple techniques to prevent Nilsimsa from detecting duplicates:</p>
<p></div></p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Random addition: requires >300% of additional text to prevent detection.</li>
<li>Thesaurus substitutions: require >20% of replaced text</li>
<li>Perceptive substitution (security > s3cur1ty): requires >15% of the text to be altered</li>
<li>Aimed attacks (i.e. attacks which specifically target Nilsimsa): ~10% of the text needs to be altered</li>
</ol>
Aimed attacks manipulate Nilsimsa's accumulators by adding words which introduce new tri-grams that specifically alter the hash value. Although these attacks are relatively effective, they can be easily circumvented by computing the Nilsimsa hash twice with different hash functions.</p>
