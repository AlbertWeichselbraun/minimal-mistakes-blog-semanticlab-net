<p>by Agarwal et al. (WSDM2008, agarwal2008)</p>
<p>The goal of this article is to provide a method for identifying influential bloggers.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>outlinks: resources referred to by a post's author</li>
<li>inlinks: resources which refer to that particular post -- collected using the technorati API</li>
</ul>
The authors define the following four properties of influential bloggers:</p>
<ul>
<li> recognitions (=> the post if referred to in many other posts)</li>
<li>activity generation (the post yields a large number of comments)</li>
<li>novelty (a large number of outlinks indicates that a post is less likely to be novel)</li>
<li>eloquence (the length of a post is positively correlated to its influence)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Influence graph:</strong>
Each post is represented by a node which is characterized by the four properties discussed above. the graph is a directed graph in which edges represent the incoming and outgoing influence flows between nodes.</p>
<p>Finally, the paper also observes and discusses different temporal patterns of influentials (long-term, average-term, transient, and burgeoning).</p>
