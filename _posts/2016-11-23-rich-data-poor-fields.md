This article shows how handheld devices and big data technology may multiply field yields and make farming more environmentally friendly.

* GPS enabled precision leveling techniques and soil sampling reduce water and fertilizer consumption while increasing the farmer's yield.
* *data mining* and *maschine learning* help in analyzing satelity data, ground surveys, and past data on the climate, relief, geology and vegetation, supporting farmers in deciding (i) what to grow on and (ii) how to treat the soil;
* hyperspectral imaging using satellites, drones and handheld devices recognizes diseases at an early stage
* hand-held analytics devices help analyzing irregularities with the crop
