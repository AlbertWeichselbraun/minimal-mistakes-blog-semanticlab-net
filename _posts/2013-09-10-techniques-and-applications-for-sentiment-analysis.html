<p><span style="font-family: Sans;">Feldman, R. (2013). Techniques and applications for sentiment analysis. <em>Communications of the ACM</em>, <em>56</em>(4), 82&mdash;89. doi:10.1145/2436256.2436274</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Sans;">The article provides an overview over the following five problems in the field of sentiment analysis:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Sans;">document level sentiment analysis</span>,</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Sans;">sentence level sentiment analysis,</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Sans;">aspect-based sentiment analysis,</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Sans;">comparative sentiment analysis, and</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Sans;">sentiment lexicon acquisition</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Sans;">Selected methods</span></h2>
<span style="font-family: Sans;"><strong>Document level</strong></span><span style="font-family: Sans;"> sentiment analysis either uses supervised or unsupervised approaches to determine the sentiment. Another interesting method determines the PMI of phrases to positive (excellent) and negative (poor) words to compute the phrase&tilde;s polartiy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Sans;"><strong>Sentence level </strong></span><span style="font-family: Sans;">sentiment analysis often further split the sentences into homogeneous phrases, if that is required. Research also suggest that it is beneficial to handle special kind of sentences (e.g. conditional sentences, sarcasm, ...) differently [1]. </span><span style="font-family: Sans;">Such methods must be combined with approaches for detecting these sentence classes, e.g. Davidov et al. [2] for sarcams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Sans;"><strong>Aspect-based sentiment </strong>analysis which is also known as feature-based sentiment analysis considers that products have different aspects (attributes, properties) which in turn may receive different opinions. The extraction of implicit aspects (e.g. žit is quite heavy rather than žthe battery life is extensive) is still an interesting research topic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Sans;"><strong>Comparative sentiment analysis </strong></span><span style="font-family: Sans;">draws upon sentences that compare sentiment targets. Jundal and Liu [3] have shown that a small number of words such as the ones listed below covers up to 98% of all comparisons.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Comparative: more, less, &brvbar; word endings with -er (lighter, smaller, &brvbar;)</li>
<li>Superlative: most, last, &brvbar; word endings with -est (lightest, finest, &brvbar;)</li>
<li>Additional phrases: favor, exceed, outperform, prefer, than, superior, inferior, number one, up against, ...)</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: Sans;"><strong>Sentiment lexicon acquisition </strong></span><span style="font-family: Sans;">is another interesting research area that uses methods such as WordNet distance to the terms </span><span style="font-family: Sans;"><em>good</em></span><span style="font-family: Sans;"> and </span><span style="font-family: Sans;"><em>bad</em></span><span style="font-family: Sans;"> or double propagation to discover sentiment terms.</span></p>
<h2> <span style="font-family: Sans;">Selected applications</span></h2></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-family: Sans;">Google product search</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Sans;">Twitterfeel.com - how does a word feels on Twitter</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Sans;">Stocksonar.com</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Sans;">Stockwits.com - analyzes tweets that contain stock symbols</span></li>
</ol>
