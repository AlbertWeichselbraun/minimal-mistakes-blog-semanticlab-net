<p>Ma, Z., Sheng, O.R.L. &amp; Pant, G., 2009. Discovering company revenue relations from news: A network approach. <em>Decission Support Systems</em>, 47(4), pp.408&mdash;414.</p>
<p>This article also draws upon network metrics to solve a binary classification problem (see my <a title="Mining Competitor Relationships from Online News" href="http://blog.semanticlab.net/2013/03/08/mining-competitor-relationships-from-online-news-a-network-based-approach/">previous post</a>), but applies the binary classifier to company revenue relations (higher revenue true/false) rather than to competitor relations (is a competitor true/false). The authors are able to achieve a precision close to 80% for predicting a company's relative revenue (i.e., revenue rank).</p>
<h1>Introduction and Related Work</h1></p>
<ol>
<li>the company revenue relation (CRR) is defined as a simple value that indicates whether the target company is "more powerful" (has a higher review) than the source company.</li>
<li>Graph-based attributes often reflect certain properties of nodes.</li>
<ul>
<li>outdegree - centralitiy</li>
<li>indegree - prestige, authority (which suggests that a company with a higher indegree (i.e. higher media coverage) <em>within a business sector </em>might be more powerful than a company with a lower one).</li>
</ul></p>
<li>In contrast to forecast models, this approach does not rely on any prior information on the company's revenues.</li>
<li>The relation between news and and stock ratings as well as exchange-rate movements have been thoroughly studied by research such as the one performed by Engel and Ng (1993), Conrad et al. (2002), and Domiguez and Panthaki (2006).</li>
</ol></p>
<h1>Method</h1>
The authors compare the following revenue relations between companies using their CRR measure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sectoral revenue rank</li>
<li>Normalized revenue rank
\[ \text{rank}(n_i) = \frac{\text{revenue rank}(n_i)}{ |\text{sector}(n_i)| } \]</li></p>
<li>Revenue share
\[ \text{revenue share}(n_j) = \frac{\text{revenue}(n_i)} {\sum_{n_j \in\text{sector}(n_i)} \text{revenue}(n_j)} \]</li>
</ol>
where $$sector(n_i)$$ refers to all companies in the sector to which company $$n_i$$ belongs. All three measures delivered approximately the same performance.</p>
