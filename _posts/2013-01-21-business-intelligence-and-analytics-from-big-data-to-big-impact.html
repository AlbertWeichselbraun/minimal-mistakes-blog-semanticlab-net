<div class="csl-entry">Chen, H., Chiang, R.H.L. &amp; Storey, V.C., 2012. Business Intelligence and Analytics: From Big Data to Big Impact. <em>MIS Quarterly</em>, 36(4), pp.1165&mdash;1188.</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The following article discusses the rise of Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&amp;A) and its growing importance for businesses. Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus professor at the University of  California commented:<em> "So what's getting ubiquitous and cheap? Data. And what is complementary to data? Analysis."</em></p>
<p>The authors distinguish the following BI&amp;A flavors:</p>
<ol>
<li>BI&amp;A 1.0 - Database based and limited to structured content</li>
<ul>
<li>already integrated into commercial enterprise IT systems</li>
</ul></p>
<li>BI&amp;A 2.0 - Web-based and handles unstructured content; includes Web intelligence and web analytics</li>
<ul>
<li>Web site design, product placement optimizations, customer transaction analysis, market structure analysis, product recommendations</li>
<li>social media - companies treat the market as a "conversation" rather than traditional business-to-customer one way marketing</li>
</ul></p>
<li>BI&amp;A 3.0 - Mobile and sensor-based content</li>
<ul>
<li>handles data obtained from mobile phones and data, devices equipped with RFID, barcodes, and radio tags ("Internet of things"</li>
<li>customization, location-aware, person-centered, and context-relevant operations</li>
</ul>
</ol></p>
<h2>Applications</h2></p>
