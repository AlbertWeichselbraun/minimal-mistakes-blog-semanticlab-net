<p>This article presents a user study which shows that users prefer search results which are not only (i) <strong>relevant</strong> but also (ii) <strong>cover</strong> many different places (=spatial diversity). It summarizes different approaches mentioned in the literature for assessing spatial diversity and performs a user study based on the following three metrics: (i) Geometric Mean (GM), SC-1, and SC-2.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recall considering diversity at rank K:
S-recall at K = total number of subtopics found in the K documents / total number of subtopics in the given topic.</li>
</ul></p>
<div><strong>Ideas</strong></div></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Crowdsourcing: <strong>identify cheaters</strong> by inserting "gold standard data" into the task</li>
<li>The<strong> evaluation</strong> is based on a three level preference schema (prefer results, neutral, prefer alternative).</li>
</ul>
</div></p>
