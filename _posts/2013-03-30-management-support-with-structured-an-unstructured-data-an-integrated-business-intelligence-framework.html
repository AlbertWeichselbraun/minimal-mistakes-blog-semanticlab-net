<div class="csl-entry">Baars, Henning, and Hans-George Kemper. Management Support with Structured and Unstructured Data-An Integrated Business Intelligence Framework.¬ù <em>Information Systems Management</em> 25, no. 2 (March 2008): 132&mdash;148.</div>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
Three different trends have been drivers for the increased importance of BI</p>
<ol>
<li>more turbulent, global business environments</li>
<li>pressure to unveil valid risk and performance indicators to stakeholders, and</li>
<li>aggravated challenges of effectiveely managing more and more densely interwoven processes.</li>
</ol>
The most salient BI tools for addressing these challenges are still:</p>
<ol>
<li>reporting</li>
<li>data mining and</li>
<li>OLAP</li>
</ol></p>
<h1>Business Intelligence Framework</h1>
BI frameworks provide a structure for BI infrastructure that enables holistic decision support. In the past there have been three classes of BI frameworks building either on</p>
<ol>
<li>the concept of the data warehouse focusing on the technical aspects</li>
<li>a broad organizational and demand-driven view</li>
<li> partial structures for specific approaches.</li>
</ol>
Baars and Kemper introduce a <strong>Multi-Layer BI Framework</strong> that consists of the following layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>data layer - stores structured and unstructured data which has usually been transformed using Extract Transform Load (ETL) components.</li>
<li>logical layer - responsible for data analysis and includes processes such as OLAP, data mining and the generation of business reports and ad hoc analysis.</li>
<li>access layer - provides easy access to these functionalities, e.g. by using some kind of portal software.</li>
</ol>
They also distinguish the following approaches for integrating structured and unstructured data</p>
<ol>
<li>integrated presentation - the integration takes place in the access layer only</li>
<li>analysis and content collection - unstructured content is already handled at the data collection layer</li>
<li>distribution of analyses results and analysis templates - connects components on the logic layer (e.g. analysis systems and components for knowledge distribution such as a CMS); automated processes may extract relevant business data from the CMS and automatically publish documents summarizing the result of BI processes.</li>
</ol></p>
<h1>Applications</h1></p>
<h2>Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</h2>
CRM binds all customer oriented activities together and, therefore, integrates all marketing, sales, and service processes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Operational CRM: supports day-to-day activities</li>
<li>Collaborative CRM: integrates the management of all customer touch points (mail, phone, ..)</li>
<li>Analytical CRM: performs data analysis</li>
</ol></p>
<h2>Competitive Intelligence (CI)</h2>
CI focuses on all processes for gathering and analyzing information about the competition and the general market environment (SCIP, 2005).</p>
<ol>
<li>the most relevant CI information is from outside the company borders (financial reports of competitors, government publications, patent databases, Web, .... (compare Lux and Peske, 2002)</li>
<li>Examples:</li>
<ul>
<li>analysis of press reports reveals weak signals regarding shifts in public opinion</li>
<li>product reviews indicate customer satisfaction</li>
<li>patent analysis using clustering yields research trends and the strategic orientation of the competition; estimate how this might affect the future sales of certain product groups</li>
<li>market data might reveal the impact of new substitute produces on sales</li>
</ul>
</ol></p>
