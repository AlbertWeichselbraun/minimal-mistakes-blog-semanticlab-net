<p><strong>1. General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>confirms the Polyanna Hypothesis which states that people have a preference for using positive words and expressions suggesting that we should be able to find more positive than negative sentiment terms.</li>
<li>Turney and Littman - obtained the sentiment of a word by determining if it co-occurs more often with a set of positive words than with a set of negative words.</li>
</ul>
<strong>2. Method</strong></p>
<p>The method consists of two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>identify a seed set of positive and negative words by using affix patterns (dis-, im-, in-, mal-, mis-, non-, un-, -less, ill-, ir-, -ful -- e.g. honest - dishonest; happy - unhappy, ...)</li>
<li>use a thesaurus to mark the words synonymous with the positive set "positive" and the words synonymous with the negative set "negative"</li>
</ol>
<strong>2.1. Seed words</strong></p>
<p>Based on the general inquirer or on affix patterns as described below:</p>
<ol>
<li>marked words such as dishonest, unhappy, inpure, ... -> negative</li>
<li>unmarked words such as happy, honest, ... -> positive (there are some exceptions but they are clearly in the minority)</li>
</ol>
<strong>2.2. Generalization</strong></p>
<p>Mark the thesaurus's paragraphs and terms positive or negative, depending on which group of words occurs more often.</p>
<p><strong>3. Evaluation:</strong></p>
<p>The method is evaluated by</p>
<ol>
<li>computing the overlap with a manually generated lexicon (general inquirer)</li>
<li>comparing the performance of the lexicon in evaluating the MPQA corpus (http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa)</li>
</ol>
<strong>4. Visualization</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>based on a force-directed graph layout which shows the original sentiment lexicon and its extensions.</li>
<li>the authors use the NodeXL (http://www.codeplex.com/NodeXL) tool to create visualizations which
<ul>
<li>contain a smaller subset of the lexicon</li>
<li>and have been cleaned up using graph-theoretic metrics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol></p>
