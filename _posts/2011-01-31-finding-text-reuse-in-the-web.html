<p>by Michael Bendersky and W. Bruce Croft (WSDM'09)</p>
<p>This article discusses an approach for finding three different kinds of text reuse in the web:</p>
<ul>
<li>verbatim copies (nearly duplicate sentences)</li>
<li>restatements</li>
<li>references to the same event which only bears topical similarity to the original sentence</li>
</ul>
The most interesting points discussed in this article are:</p>
<ol>
<li>the presented <strong>algorithm</strong> for retrieving <strong>related sentences</strong></li>
<li>discussed measurements for determining text reuse (word overlap, query likelihood, mixture model, dependence model)</li>
<li>different approaches to determine a source's date (earliest date, earliest date in the longest dense sequence, closest date in context, ...)</li>
</ol>
The points above could be relevant for DIVINE as well as for our new FP7 projects.</p>
