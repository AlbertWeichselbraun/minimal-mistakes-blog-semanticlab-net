<p>The idea of knowledge management systems (KMS) is unlocking knowledge heretofore only accessible in the minds of certain organizational members. </p>
<p>Unfortunately several factors prevent members from sharing knowledge:
(i) People garnered considerable knowledge gain power by holding unique knowledge, and (ii) it provides them with a competitive advantage.
On the downside, they have to solve the same problem over and over again, because other people cannot access solutions over public interfaces like "knowledge bases".</p>
<p>Knowledge bases are public goods and suffer from the fundamental issue of "free riders". Current research identified three factors positively influencing KMS adoption:</p>
<ul>
<li>encouragement by the management ("nagging" *g*)</li>
<li>loyality to the firm or group</li>
<li>personal values (social value orientation)</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The later factor requires individuals who's personal profile can be described as <i>collectivist</i> in contrast to <i>competitors</i> (maximizing the distance between themselves and others) and <i>individualists</i> (maximizing their own return regardless of others).</p>
