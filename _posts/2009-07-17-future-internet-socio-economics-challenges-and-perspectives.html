<p>This is a very general high level article on the Future Internet which identifies issues like</p>
<ul>
<li>scalability and address space limitations</li>
<li>balance of 'privacy' versus 'sharing'</li>
<li>need for security</li>
<li>trust as a major issue</li>
<li>customization</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Finally, the article notes that different initiatives towards the Future Internet (EU, US, Korea) are pursued by different organizations which might lead to a market of competing Future Internets. </p>
