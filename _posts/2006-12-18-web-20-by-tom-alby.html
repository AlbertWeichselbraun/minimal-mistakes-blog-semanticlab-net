<p>
Yesterday I finally got the time to read some of the new literature I ordered and I decided to start with tom ALBYS "Web 2.0".
Relevant information for semanticlabs regarding this book include:
 a) the book gives a fine definition of social software, including its main characteristics.
 b) a good overview over blogging (including information on Pingomatics - rpc.pingomatic.com, ping.wordblog.de) and blog search engines (www.technorati.com, feedster, newsgator, ...).
 c) interesting sites, covered are</p>
<ul>
<li>www.flickr.com</li>
<li>iq.lycos.de</li>
<li>last.fm (a site recording the actual use of music)</li>
<li>43things.com</li>
<li>digg.com (user defined media)</li>
<li>plazes.com (a mashup of google-map and flickR)</li>
<li>Podcasts (www.podcast.de) and clients (juicereceiver.sourceforge.net).
</ul></p>
<p>The book gives the user a good, not so much technical overview over various aspects of the Web 2.0 including possible Business Modells (e.g. The Long Tail, Google AdWords and AdSense, etc.).</p>
