<div>Eng, J., 2005. Receiver Operating Characteristic Analysis: A Primer1. <em>Academic Radiology</em>, 12(7), pp.909&mdash;916.</div>
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2></p>
<div>This article summarizes the use of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) for <em>binary classification</em> tasks. The ROC visualizes the trade-off between sensitivity (recall for true positives) and specificity (recall for true negatives).</div></p>
<div>The area under the ROC curve (abbreviated AUC) is commonly used as an indicator for the classifier's performance.</div></p>
<h2>Construction of the ROC curve</h2></p>
<ol>
<li>obtain classifications and the corresponding confidence (e.g. definitely negative, probable negative, possible negative, ...)</li>
<li>compute the sensitivity and specificity at different cutoff levels (e.g. only consider definite negative classifications as negative).</li>
<li>Visualize the trade-off between sensitivity (true positives) and 1-specificity (false positives).</li>
</ol>
