<h2>Relevant Factors</h2>
The article evaluates the following extrinsic factors that may influence the response rate in social question and answering (social Q&amp;A). The numbers in brackets indicate the correlation coefficients obtained.</p>
<ol>
<li>Number of followers (0.21)</li>
<li>Frequency of posting (very high and very low frequencies reduce the number of answers; -0.14)</li>
<li>Number of @mentions (which is also considered a strong predictor of information diffusion and a significant factor for increasing a post's visibility; 0.20).</li>
<li>Number of @mentions to general/verified accounts within the micro blogging site (-0.33/0.03)</li>
<li>Use of hashtags (-0.18)</li>
<li>Emoticons (0.10)</li>
<li>Repeated punctuation and interjections (not significant)</li>
<li>Expression of gratitude (not significant)</li>
<li>Topic (depends on the category - between -0.08 for electronics and 0.63 for entertainment)</li>
<li>Posting time (the time period between 0:00 and 6:00 am yielded the lowest number of responses, the differences between the other time periods are not significant).</li>
</ol></p>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
The evaluation draws upon <em>Sina Weibo</em>, China's largest micro blogging site, analyzing questions and answers within a 10-day period and considering only distinct answer. The authors use multiple linear regression analysis to verify the impact of these predictors yielding a model which accounts for roughly 19% of the total variance. Multicollinearity was checked by examining the bivariate correlations across all predictor variables.</p>
