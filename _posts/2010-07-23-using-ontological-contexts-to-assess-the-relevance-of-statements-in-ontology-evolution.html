<p>by Fouad Zablith, Mathieu d'Aquin, Marta Sabou, and Enrico Motta</p>
<p>This work describes a method for judging the <em>relevance</em> statements suggested by ontology evolution tools for an existing ontology.</p>
<p>The relevance assessment process consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>locate possible online ontologies for contextualization based on the statements subject and object (=involved concepts).</li>
<li>identify the context C of the new statement based on online ontologies using the Jaro-Winkler string similarity metric (extract all nodes contained both ontologies).</li>
<li>estimate the relevance of the statement using (a) overlap analysis, or (b) a pattern-based relevance assessment.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Overlap Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The overlap analysis computes the relevance based on the overlap between the context and the evolving ontology.</p>

\[conf_{overlap} (c, C, O) = \frac{ |e(C) \hut e(O_t)|}{e(O_t)} \]

<p>A drawback of this method is, that it considers all statements equally important.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern-Based Relevance Assessment</strong></p>
<p>This method considers the structure in which the concepts appear. The authors have identified five patterns and determined the patterns' relative importance for detecting relevant statements.</p>
<p>The evaluation has been performed based on three different domains by</p>
<ul>
<li>automatically determining statements for a given base ontology</li>
<li>having domain experts evaluate these statements and computing a per statement relevance score.</li>
<li>comparing this score to the suggestion by the metrics introduced above.</li>
</ul>
The method is highly relevant, but still only deals with <em>quite similar ontologies</em>, which are extended based on a <em>common conceptualization.</em></p>
