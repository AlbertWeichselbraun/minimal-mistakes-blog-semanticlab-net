<p>based on: Litz, Berenike, Langer, Hagen and Malaka, Rainer (2009). ''Trigrams'n'Tags for Lexical Knowledge Acquisition'', First International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval (KDIR 2009)</p>
<p>The authors apply the Trigram'n'Tags (TnT) approach to the task of detecting hierarchical relations in domain text and compare the results with data obtained from Hearst patterns and a simplistic approach.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>application of a POS tagger to relation detection</li>
<li>the work is done on the <em>german</em> wikipedia</li>
<li>the applied TnT approach, which is supposed to be particularly powerful.</li>
</ul></p>
