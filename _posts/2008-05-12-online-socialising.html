<p>...an article I got from Walter without any reference to the author.</p>
<p>Two facts the article mentioned I found particular interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>News Corp. was paying a huge amount for facebook</li>
<li>Seok Kang found out, that online chat has a negative effect on social psychological well-being [1] - "online interaction with a lack of non-verbal cues leads to offline loneliness and depression".</li>
</ul></p>
<p>[1] Seok Kang. Disembodiment in online social interaction: "Impact of online chat on social support and psychosocial well-being". Cyberpsychology & behavior, 10(3), 2007</p>
