<p>Kan, Min-Yen and Tan, Yee Fan: Record Matching in Digital Library Metdata, Communications of the ACM, Volume 51 (2), 91-94</p>
<p>The article provides an excellent overview over techniques used to identify duplicate records in digital libraries.
The authors presents </p>
<ul>
<li><i>uniform string matching</i> techniques based on set-matching (the Jaccard measure, cosine similarity, degree of similarity, ...), sequence based measures (edit distance), and hyprid approaches (e.g. set-matching for single words and sequence based measures for the terms in sentences), and</li>
<li><i>graphical formalisms</i> as for instance social networks, network cuts and random walks to distinguish different authors with the same name.</li>
</ul></p>
