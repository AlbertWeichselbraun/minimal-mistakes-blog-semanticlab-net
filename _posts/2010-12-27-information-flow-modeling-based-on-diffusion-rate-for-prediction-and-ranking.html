<p>by Song et al. (song2007)</p>
<p>Song et al. investigate the information flow in a user network. They try to (i) predict where information flows and (ii) who will most quickly receive that information given a certain sender.
The authors introduce a <em>DiffusionRank</em> algorithm which ranks users based on the time information needs to flow to them.</p>
<p>As Goya et al. (goya2010) Song et al (song2007) note that information flow modeling is related to word-of-mouth communication and therefore heavily influence by the social influence of the actors.</p>
<p>The authors suggest an information flow model which is based on a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC).
In the conclusions Song et al. (song2007) argue that a social network user's influence is somehow related to the importance of Web pages as suggested by the HITS or PageRank measures.</p>
