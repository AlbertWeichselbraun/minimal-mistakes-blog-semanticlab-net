<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is another article from the IBM Watson team that describes how they use open relation extraction to obtain knowledge on instances and classes from large text corpora.</p>
<div>
<h2>Terminology:</h2></p>
<ol>
<li>Frame ($$f_i$$): the basic semantic unit that consists of slots (binary relations) and the corresponding value pairs. A frame represents a set of entities and their relations in a piece of text.
$$f_i = \{(s_1, v_1), (s_2, v_2), ... (s_n, v_m)\}$$
Example: <(<em>verb</em>, receive), (<em>subj</em>, Einstein), (<em>obj</em>, Nobel prize, ...)</li></p>
<li>Slot ($$s_i$$): a binary relation such as (<em>awarded, $$v_i$$)</em>.</li>
<li>Slot value ($$v_i$$): the lemma form of an extracted term (e.g. žNovel Prize for the slot žawarded)</li>
<li>Frame projection: a portion of a frame, that occurs in many frames that is then used to derive class information from these frames (e.g. scientists publish, ...)</li>
</ol></p>
<h2>Method</h2>
PRISMATIC uses a three step knowledge extraction method:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Corpus processing</strong> - all sentences are annotated using the English Slot Grammar (ESG) dependency parser, a simple rule based co-reference resolution (McCord et al, 2012), and a rule-based named entity recognition to assign entity types using the <em>isA</em> slot.</li>
<li><strong>Frame extraction</strong> - Frames are extracted based on the dependency parses and associated annotations. Only relationships which represent participant information of a predicate are extracted and each frame is restricted to two levels deep at the most</li>
<li><strong>Frame projection</strong> - provide an aggregated view of selected parts of the frames (e.g. subject-verb-object or verb-objectType) to extract general (class) knowledge. The following aggregated statistics are provided by frame projections:</li>
<ul>
<li><em>Frequency</em> (the number of frames whose slot values match) - popularity measure</li>
<li>Conditional probability - shows how probable a particular instance is (e.g. for subject-verb-object - how often žEinstein wins the nobel prize if he wins something)</li>
<li><em>Normalized pointwise mutal information - </em>>shows the degree of co-occurrence between frames.
$$npmi(f, f') = \frac{pmi(f, f')}{-ln\frac{(max[\#(f),\#(f')])}{N}}$$ with [-1, 1]</li>
</ul>
</ol></p>
