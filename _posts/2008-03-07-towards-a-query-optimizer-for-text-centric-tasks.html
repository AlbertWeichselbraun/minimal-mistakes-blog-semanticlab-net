<p>by Panagiots Ipeirotis et al.</p>
<p>The idea of the article is to provide strategies for optimal choosing between different crawl-/query strategies (like scan, filter, ...) for text-centric tasks addressing the following trade offs:</p>
<ul>
<li>query-based execution might miss relevant documents</li>
<li>scan based strategies take a lot of time</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The authors introduce several use cases, and define each task as deriving tokens from a large databsae.</p>
<p>The most interesting points in term of our current paper projects are:</p>
<ul>
<li>definition of the execution time (including training time into the model) </li>
<li>description of multiple execution strategies which are applied to the model (scan, filter, iterative set expansion, automated query generation)</li>
<li>query based strategies outperformed crawling based approaches for a related data classification task</li>
<li>the methodology of updating statistics at key points for adjusting the plan for the rest of the execution refers to <i>reoptimization methods</i> as described by Kabra and DeWitt [1998]</li>
</ul></p>
