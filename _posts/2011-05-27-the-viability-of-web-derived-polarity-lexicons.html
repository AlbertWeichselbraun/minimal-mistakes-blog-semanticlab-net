<p>by Velikovich et al. (Google research)
</p>
<p>This paper describes an approach for semi-automatically generating sentiment lexicon from seed terms and a Web corpus. The authors create a graph of phrases and use a graph propagation algorithm to determine how positive and negative polarity propagates through this graph.
The graph has the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>node set V: contains the candidate phrases (=n-grams up to a length of ten) </li>
<li>set of edges E: connect two candidate phrases based on the cosine similarity of their context vector; the context vector is composed by aggregating the terms appearing within a six word window over all mentions of the phrase in the Web corpus</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The authors discuss why their propagation method is expected to outperform <i>labeled propagation</i>, which works well with high quality data but not with noisy and untrustworthy graphs constructed from the Web.


<b>Evaluation Measure</b>
Finally, the authors present an evaluation which makes use of the following purity measure:</p>
\[ purity(X) = \sum_{ x \in X } pol_x / ( \delta + \sum_{ x \in X } |pol_x| ) \]
</p>
<p>Due to the parameter \delta this measure assigns higher scores to sentences which contain multiple sentiment phrases.
This purity measure normalizes the polarity score to the range [-1,1] and yields higher values for sentences containing <b>only</b> positive or negative terms.


<b>Conclusion</b>
The evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms traditional lexicons because to generated dictionaries contain a wider range of phrases such as</p>
<ul>
<li>spelling variations</li>
<li>slang</li>
<li>vulgarity, and</li>
<li>multi-word expressions</li>
</ul>
which have not been available to previous systems.</p>
