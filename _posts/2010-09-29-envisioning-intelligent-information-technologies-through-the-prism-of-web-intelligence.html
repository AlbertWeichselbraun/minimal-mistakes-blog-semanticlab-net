<p>Zhong et al. (Communications of the ACM) - coined the term Web Intelligence (see literature)</p>
<p>This article introduces <strong>intelligent Information Technology (iIT)</strong> which builds upon <strong>Web Intelligence</strong> and the <strong>World Wide Web of Wisdom</strong> and provides a novel view on the possible use of Web portals for (i) Web Intelligence, (ii) problem solving and (iii) as information systems for management support.<em></em></p>
<p>The authors propose that such technologies could either be used to</p>
<ul>
<li>progress science and technology by discovering new scientific laws or</li>
<li>turn these knowledge into money by using it for strategic and tactical business decisions</li>
</ul>
<strong>Web Intelligence</strong> which was introduced to facilitate</p>
<ol>
<li>information empowerment</li>
<li>knowledge sharing</li>
<li>virtual social communities</li>
<li>service enrichment and</li>
<li>practical wisdom development</li>
</ol>
The <strong>Wisdom Web</strong> as used as a medium for (i) information exchange and sharing and (ii) a resource for knowledge creation and scientific and social evolutions.</p>
<p>The authors suggest the use of PSML (problem solver markup language) which is supposed to be a logic language for creating intelligence enterprise portals. They believe that iIT could yield tools and infrastructure for generating intelligent portals throughout the Web.</p>
