<p>by Bernd Hafenrichter and Werner Kie&Atilde;&Yuml;ling.</p>
<p>The article provided us with an insight into personal preferences, which are often expressed as <i>wishes</i>: "Wishes are free, but there is no guarantee that they can be satisfied".
Computer science therefore models preferences as <i>soft constraints</i> with a <i>strict partial order</i>.</p>
<p>The paper continues with the introduction of preference query models and mentions the languages <i>Preference SQL</i> and <i>Preference XPATH<i>. Finally it presents transformation laws for optimizing preference queries based on their formulation in the relational algebra.</p>
