<p>Leidner, Jochen L. (2006). ''An evaluation dataset for the toponym resolution task'', Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, pages 400-417</p>
<p>This paper motivates the need for a geo-reference corpus for evaluating geo-tagging and describes the process of designing such a corpus (including a reference gazetteer).
According to Leidner both, corpus and gazetteer, need to be specified because the gazetteer influences the outcome of
any evaluation experiment.</p>
<p><b>Criteria for the gazeteer selection</b>
The author states six criteria, including <i>(i) scope, (ii) coverage, (iii) correctness, (iv) granularity, (v) balance (uniform degree of detail, correctness, etc.), and (vi) the richness of annotation.</p>
<p><b>Geo-Tagging</b>
Leidner defines the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>geo-coding</i>: Mapping from implicitly geo-referenced data to an explicitly geo-referenced representation (grounding)</li>
<li><i>named-entity processing</i>: consists of two-steps: (a) flat text <i>span</i> recognition (where does a name begin/end), (b) <i>atomic classification/grounding</i> (what type of name is it)
 </ul></p>
