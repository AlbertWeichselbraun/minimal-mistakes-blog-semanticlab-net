<p>by Wan, X. and Yang, J (wan2007)</p>
<p>The authors present an approach which identifies the diffusion process for a particular topic.
Sets of documents with a given topic ($$D={d_1, ... d_n}$$) are associated with a tuple containing a time stamp denoting the time at which the document was published at the $$LocationSite_i$$ $$(t_i, LocationSite_i)$$.
Due to the diffusion process we get $$[LocationSite_j: d_j \rightarrow LocationSite_i: d_i] (t_j<t_i)$$</p>
<p>They use a support vector machine (SVM) with the following features to determine whether d_j is the source of d_i:</p>
<ul>
<li>metadata-based features</li>
<li>cueword-based features: do appear cuewords (forward, from, source) mentioning the source's name in the document</li>
<li>similarity-based features: cosine similarity</li>
</ul></p>
