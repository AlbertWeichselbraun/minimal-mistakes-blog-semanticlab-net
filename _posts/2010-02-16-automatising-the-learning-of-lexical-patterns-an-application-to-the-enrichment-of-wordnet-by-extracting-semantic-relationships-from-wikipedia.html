<p>by Maria Ruiz-Casado et al.</p>
<p>Ruiz-Casado et al. extend WordNet by extracting hyponym, hyperonym, holonym and meronym relations from the <a title="WikiPedia (simple english version)" href="http://simple.wikipedia.org">simple english version of WikiPedia</a>. The authors automize</p>
<ul>
<li>the extraction of relations and</li>
<li>the process of learning textual patterns modeling these relations (e.g. X is one of the PLURAL-NOUN in Y)</li>
</ul>
The described approach applies the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>word sense disambiguation</li>
<li>pattern extraction based on existing relations in WordNet</li>
<li>pattern generalization of the patterns retrieved in the step above</li>
<li>identification of new relations</li>
</ul>
The authors show that the precision of the generated patterns is similar to patterns written by hand.</p>
