<p>[Banko:2008] Banko, Michele and Etzioni, Oren (2008). ''The Tradeoffs Between Open and Traditional Relation Extraction'', Proceedings of ACL-08: HLT, Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 28--36</p>
<p>This article discusses the shortcomings of traditional relation extraction methods and introduces  <i>Open Relation Extraction</i> techniques.
These techniques match the precision of traditional extraction systems but do not yield the same recall, although the paper presents a hybrid method yielding comparable recall.</p>
<p>The authors apply Conditional Random Fields (CRF), which are undirected graphical models trained to maximize the conditional probability of a finite set of labels Y given a set of input observations X.
The algorithm considers features such as part-of-speech (POS) tags, regular expressions (capitalization, punctation, etc.), context words and conjunctions of features occurring in a sliding windows of 13 words .
The authors train their method with sets of labeled examples.</p>
<p>Entities are extracted by performing</p>
<ul>
<li>entity identification using a phrase chunker, and</li>
<li>labeling relations for possible entitiy pairs</li>
</ul>
Finally, they apply the RESOLVER algorithm to identify synonyms.</p>
<p>The issue of low recall is addressed by creating a relation-specific algorithm (R1-CRF), which the authors combine with the generic approach.</p>
