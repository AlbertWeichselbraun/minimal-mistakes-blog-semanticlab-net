<p>by Jung-Min Kim et al.</p>
<p>The paper presents an philosophy ontology created by the authors. Especially the methodology outlined and the literature review provide interesting information regarding the field of ontology extension.</p>
<p>Current research distinguishes between <i>forward</i> and <i>backward</i> engineering.</p>
<p>Forward engineering analyzes knowledge resources, extracts concepts and establishes relations among them. Methodologies like Enterprise Methodology, TOronto Virtual Enterprise, Development 101, ... are examples for this approach.</p>
<p>In contrast backward engineering extracts concepts and relations from textual resources mostly by combining NLTP techniques in semi-automatic processes.</p>
<p>The following steps have been applied in creating the philosophy ontology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scope identification: primary objectives, scrope, granularity, etc.</li>
<li>Knowledge acquisition: collects information resources on which the ontology is baed</li>
<li>Conceptualization: formalizes, organizes and structures the acquired knowledge in ontological constructs like <i>concpets</i>, <i>hierarchies</i>, and <i>properties</i>.</li>
<li>Implementation: Transforms the ontology into a machine-interpretable data model</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The paper also presents naming conventions for ontological concepts, which could prove useful if applied to our current ontology extension architecture.</p>
