<p>by Martin Szomszor, Ivan Cantador, Harith Alani (+)</p>
<p>The article focuses on comparing <i>tag-clouds</i> from multiple folksonomies (namely del.icio.us and flickr). At first the authors present tag-classification schemes currently used in literature (topic, type, quality, notion of self reference, task organization).
Afterwards the paper presents a filtering architecture for merging similar tags by:
 a) syntactic filtering (remove umlaute, ...)
 b) identification of misspelled words (google <i>did you mean</i>) function.
 c) wikipedia correlation to merge similar tags (ny -> New York City, ...)
 d) morphological similarity (stemming and singularization -> <a href="http://snowball.tartarus.org">snowball library</a>)
 e) identification of synonyms using wordnet</p>
<p>The authors identify matching user profiles and use them for evaluating the approach based on metrics introduced in the paper (assignment intersection ratio and tag intersection ratio). </p>
