<p>by Wang et al. (GIR 2005)</p>
<p>The articles of the author distinguish between three different types of geographic locations</p>
<ul>
<li>the provider location (= source location),</li>
<li>the content location (=target location), and</li>
<li>the serving location which refers to the geographic scope that a Web resource can reach.</li>
</ul></p>
<div>
<div>The authors include gazetteers which consider (i) geographic names, (ii) <strong>zip codes</strong>, and (iii) <strong>phone numbers</strong> and evaluate their approach by computing precision, recall, and the F1 measure.</div></p>
<div></div>

<div><strong>Comments: </strong>Based on this article and work by Amitay we can identify the following steps which are required to detect geographic locations:</div></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>geoparsing -- identification of geographic references in text,</li>
<li>geocoding or grounding -- disambiguation of place names, and</li>
<li>selection of the geographic focus -- assign the most relevant location to that document [amitay]</li>
</ul>
</div></p>
