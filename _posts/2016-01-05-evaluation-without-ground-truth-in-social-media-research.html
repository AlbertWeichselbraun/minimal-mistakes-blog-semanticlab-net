<div>Zafarani, Reza, and Huan Liu. Evaluation Without Ground Truth in Social Media Research. <i>Communcations of the ACM</i> 58, no. 6 (May 2015): 54&mdash;60. doi:10.1145/2666680.</div></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
This paper discusses strategies for evaluating research findings in settings where no ground truth (or gold standard) is available, covering the following three types of evaluations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spatiotemporal - predict when and/or where things are going to happen</li>
<li>Causality - why events are happening, and</li>
<li>Outcome - predicting a certain outcome</li>
</ol></p>
<h4>Spatiotemporal evaluation</h4></p>
<ol>
<li>draw upon the periodicity of individual behavior (i.e. use behavior observed in the first <em>n</em> days as training to evaluate the next <em>m</em> days).</li>
<li>crowdsourcing</li>
<li>ensemble methods (combine statistically independent methods)</li>
</ol></p>
<h4>Causality evaluation</h4></p>
<ol>
<li>controlled experiments (two groups: control and treatment)</li>
<li>natural experiments
<ul>
<li>use a <em>naturally</em> occurring event to measure the influence of an independent variable</li>
<li>temporal shuffling (i.e. use control groups from the time before an influencing independent variable became active)</li>
</ul>
</li></p>
<li>nonequivalent control - select the control group to be considered similar to a randomized group</li>
<li>Granger (pseudo) causality - i.e. consider a variable <em>X</em> causal, if <em>X</em> improved the prediction of values <em>Y</em> compared to <em>Y</em> alone</li>
</ol></p>
<h4>Outcome evaluation</h4>
Outcome evaluations consider three different aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>estimating the magnitude, i.e. the size of the population which has observed the contagion
<ul>
<li>network scale-up methods - estimate the number of affected people based on (i) the ratio of <em>people known to be affected</em> to<em> people known,</em> and (ii) the population size.</li>
<li>mark and recapture - estimate the size of a population based on the number of marked and re-captured marked individuals</li>
</ul>
</li></p>
<li>estimating sample accuracy</li>
<li>estimate outcome
<ul>
<li>obtain feedback from other (correlated) indicators (i.g. alexa page rank rather than page hits).</li>
<li>modularity for community-detection problems</li>
<li>perform controlled experiments (e.g. A/B testing - i.e. a fraction of the population uses the new user interface while the other fraction acts as control group)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
