<p><b>Answering bounded continuous search queries in the world wide web</b> 
by Kukulenz and Ntoulas.</p>
<p>This article present the application of optimal stopping theory to the monitoring of web sites using user-defined keywords - also known as <i>continuous querying</i>.</p>
<p><b>Problem</b>
The goal is to return the estimated <i>k best elements</i>, considering the trade-off between <b>freshness</b> and <b>relevance</b>. The main challenges are: (i) the potentially relevant results within a time period are not known in advantage, and (ii) it is not known <i>when</i> the relevant results will appear.
This problem can be treated as finding the top-k-results in financial mathematics, or the 'Secretary Selection Problem'. </p>
<p><b>Solution</b>
A well known strategy is to observe a number of candidates without choosing them, and selecting - after this observation period - the first result, leading a higher ranking/utility as the maximal ranking observed so far.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>k</i> candidates in the stream of documents ,therefore ,means considering <i>k</i> observation periods. The main problem is to find the optimal observation times $$t_1, ... t_k$$.</p>
