<p>by Tang et al. (tang2009), SIGKDD</p>
<p>Tang et al. (2009) propose Topical Affinity Propagation (TAP) for determining the topic-level social influence of nodes in large networks. They introduce a distributed learning algorithm based on map reduce to compute influence graphs using TAP for identifying</p>
<ul>
<li>the most representative nodes for a given topic</li>
<li>the influence of neighbor nodes on a particular node</li>
<li>ways to quickly connect to a particular node through strong social ties</li>
</ul>
According to Tang et al. the main challenges for computing social influence graphs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>multi-aspect: nodes can have different influence on each other depending on the topic</li>
<li>scalability</li>
<li>link-specific importance (weight) between nodes rather than fixed node importance values.</li>
</ul></p>
