<p>A precondition for being able to talk about 'things' is that we define those things (in contrast to the sophists, who used to play with ambiguity).
A proper definition of a 'thing' fits</p>
<ul>
<li>to all instances of the object, and</li>
<li>does not match any other instances.</li>
</ul>
Such a definition provides information regarding the <i>essence</i> of things - that are those properties which make the object to the object it is.</p>
