<p>by Gomez Rodriguez, M.; Leskovec, J. &amp; Krause, A.</p>
<p>In order to study network diffusion, we need to</p>
<ol>
<li>identify the contagion (idea, information, virus, phrase),</li>
<li>track the contagion,</li>
<li>infer the <em>diffusion network</em> based on the observed <em>node/time of infection</em>-pattern.</li>
</ol>
This article discusses an algorithm for inferring diffusion networks based on this information and presents experiments based on</p>
<ol>
<li>simulated network structures, and</li>
<li>a dataset containing more than 172 million news articles from 1 million online sources mirrored between September 2008 and August 2009.</li>
</ol>
The authors use MemeTracker to identify more than 343 million textual phrases (=contagion) to track over time.</p>
