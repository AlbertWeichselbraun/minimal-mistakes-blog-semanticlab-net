<div>Abbasi, A., Adjeroh, D., Dredze, M., Paul, M. J., Zahedi, F. M., Zhao, H., Ross, A. (2014). Social Media Analytics for Smart Health. <i>IEEE Intelligent Systems</i>, <i>29</i>(2), 60&mdash;80. doi:10.1109/MIS.2014.29</div></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
People increasingly use social media for obtaining health-related information. Abbasi and Adjeroh discuss the following five dimensions to judge a medium's importance as an information provider:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>credibility; </em>an analysis of health-related website which used data taken from third-party health URL databases showed that credible sites are closely connected, while less-credible sites are dispersed across various clusters.</li>
<li><em>recency </em>was measured with time series data on product recalls, ongoing reviews, and drug safety communications which showed that for roughly 35% of the events social media was providing leading signals, contrasted to lagging signals for 50% of the observed events.</li>
<li><em>uniqueness</em> indicated that especially leading signals obtained from social media are often unique,</li>
<li><em>frequency</em> which is in general inversely proportional to salience, and</li>
<li><em>salience,</em> indicating the extend to which a topic is discussed.</li>
</ol>
