<p>Broxton, Tom, Yannet Interian, Jon Vaver, and Mirjam Wattenhofer. Catching a Viral Video.¬ù <em>Journal of Intelligent Information Systems</em> 40, no. 2 (April 1, 2013): 241&mdash;259. doi:10.1007/s10844-011-0191-2.</p>
<p>This paper investigates (i) the relationship between the <em>socialness</em> of a video and its popularity, and (ii) provides a ranking of blogs and Web sites based on their ability to spread viral videos.</p>
<h1>Method</h1></p>
<h3>Social versus Non-Social Videos</h3>
The authors segment videos based on their <em>socialness</em> which is determined by classifying their referrer sources either as <em>social</em> or <em>non-social:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>social referrers</em>: external links, embeds, unknown (the link is directly copied into the browser)</li>
<li><em>non-social referrers</em>: YouTube internal (related links, featured videos, etc.), videos found by search queries</li>
</ul></p>
<h3>Staying power of viral videos</h3>
The popularity ratio (staying power) allows distinguishing between videos that are popular over a short time spawn (e.g. through social effects) and long-term popular videos.
\[ \text{popularity ratio} = \frac{\text{Views in the second month}}{\text{Views in the first ten days}} \]</p>
<h3>Ranking the potential of Web sites to produce viral videos:</h3>
a) remove Web sites that distribute popular and unpopular videos (e.g. Facebook) by computing a ratio $$r(u)$$ of popular $$V_p$$ to unpopular videos $$V_u$$ on the Web site $$u$$<em>.</em> $$W_{100}(u)$$ refers to the set of videos with at least 100 views coming from Web site $$u$$<em>.</em></p>
<p>\[ r(u) = \frac{|V_p \cap W_{100}(u)|} {|V_p \cup V_u|} \]</p>
<p>b) compute the rank $$R(u)$$ of Web sites specialized on distributing popular videos based on the sum of view they generate.</p>
<p>\[ R(u) = \sum_{v \in V_p} \text{views(u, v)} \]</p>
<p>The authors then compare the obtained top-sites for distributing viral videos with the popular blog ranking from technorati and conclude that 49 of the top 100 video distribution sites where listed by technorati.</p>
<h1>Observations</h1></p>
<ul>
<li>People are more likely to watch videos that have been endorsed by means of social networking sites, blogs, emails or instant messaging - if such videos gain popularity they are referred to as <em>viral videos.</em></li>
<li>Viral videos tend to <strong>gain <em>and</em> loose popularity very quickly</strong> reaching their popularity peak after approximately five days, an effect that is <strong>also observed in other social media</strong>.</li>
<ul>
<li>Only 5% of the top five stories on twitter remain top stories in the following week.</li>
<li>The same is true for 13% of the top blog stories and 9% of the top YouTube videos.</li>
<li>In contrast, 50% of the top five news stories remain top stories in the following week.</li>
</ul></p>
<li>The majority of the popular videos (top 1% of videos) become popular through related videos and search</li>
<li>Viral videos have many views over a short period of time but loose too quickly on popularity for being included into the related list, that ensures a sustained number of views over time.</li>
</ul></p>
