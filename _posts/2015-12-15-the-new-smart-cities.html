<h3>Summary</h3>
This article discusses big data applications for smart cities such as sensor boxes for measuring air quality, pedestrian and traffic flows. Applications of these technologies include:</p>
<ol>
<li>better decision making for city planners</li>
<li>information services which provide the population with information on the traffic flow and air quality</li>
<li>intelligent street lamps that adjust their brightness to the current traffic</li>
</ol>
Cities using these technologies also aim at</p>
<ol>
<li>motivating their population to participate in these data gathering programs via their smart phones and</li>
<li>publishing the collected data on open data portals to foster innovations that draw upon these data.</li>
</ol>
