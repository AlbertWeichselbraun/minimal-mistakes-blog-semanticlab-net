<p>by Segaran Toby</p>
<p>An excellent guide to programming Web 2.0 applications, with code examples and excellent explanations of the used techniques.</p>
<p><b>Similarity Metrics</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Eucleadian distance</li>
<li>Pearson coefficient (corrects grade inflation; users giving constantly higher/lower ratings)</li>
<li>Tanimoto coeffient $$\frac{A \cap B}{A \cup B}$$</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Clustering</b>
The author applies Fick's law to clustering (only cluster terms, occuring in >0.1 and <0.5 percentage of the documents.</p>
<ul>
<li>hierarchical clustering</li>
<li>k-means</li>
<li>Multidimensional Scaling (the clustering distance is proportional to the relations between the terms)</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Search engines</b>
The book presents weighting techniques for search engine's, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of occurrences</li>
<li>Document location (early words have higher weights)</li>
<li>Word distance (for multiple terms)</li>
<li>Page rank</li>
<li>Link text (higher weights for terms occurring in links)</li>
</ul>
