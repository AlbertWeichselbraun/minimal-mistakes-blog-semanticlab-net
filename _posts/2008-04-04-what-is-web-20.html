<p>Design Patterns and Business Models for the Nexter Generation of Software by Tim O'Reilly (09/30/2005)</p>
<p>An excellent article elaborating the concepts and ideas behind the term "Web 2.0".
O'Reilly focuses on the Web as a platform, claiming that a platform beats an application every time.</p>
<p>He introduces architectures of participation (pay people, ask volunteers to perform the task, P2P sharing) and emphasis the importance of <i>data</i> as the driving force of Web 2.0.
Simple API's and protocols enable user participation (e.g. REST vs. SOAP) and therefore pave the way for valuable user generated content.</p>
<p>From O'Reilly's point of view the <b>core competencies of a Web 2.0 company</b> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Services, instead of packaged software (google vs. microsoft)</li>
<li>Control over unique, hard to create data sources, that get <i>richer as more people use them</i> (Amazon; Reviews, etc.)</li>
<li>Trusting users as co-developers</li>
<li>Harnessing collective intelligence</li>
<li>Leveraging the long tail through customer <i>self service</i> (Google ads)</li>
<li>Software above a single device (Skype)</li>
<li>Lightweight user interfaces, development models, <i>and</i> business models</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Excellence in <i>once</i> of the above areas might outperform small steps in all seven... ;)</p>
