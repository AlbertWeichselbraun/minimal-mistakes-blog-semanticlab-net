</p>
<p>This paper uses conditional random fields to detect negations and their scope for sentiment detection.
Based on Tottie (1991) the authors distinguish between the following kinds of negations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Denials, which are the most common forms of negations</li>
<li>Rejections, which often occur in a discurse ("Can I get you anything? No.")</li>
<li>Imperatives such as "Do not use the elevator!"</li>
<li>Questions, can often indicate negation -- Why wouldn't they sell this good at a resonable price?</li>
<li>Supports and Repetitions</li>
</ol></p>
<p>The  authors draw upon a manually annotated Product Review Corpus to  evaluate their work and present a list of explicat negation clues which  they use to detect negated sentences. Annotating text with (i) sentence  boundaries and (ii) token annotations from a dependency parser helps  determining the negation scope.  The authors also discuss how the word  POS (adverb, adjective, noun, etc.) influences the negation scope.


The paper's <strong>evaluation</strong> focuses on (i) the performance of the negation scope detection, and (ii) the improvement negation detection yields to sentiment detection.
It  shows that considering negation for sentiment detection considerably  improved the F-scores of the sentiment predictions (+ 29.5% for positive  and +11.4% for negative sentences)</p>

<div id="magicdomid21">The  paper uses a sentiment lexicon extracted from the web by using label  propagation (see Velikovich et al. - "The viability of web-derived  polarity lexicons" Proceedings of the 11th Annual Conference of the  North American Chapter of the Association for Computational  Linguistics).</div></p>
