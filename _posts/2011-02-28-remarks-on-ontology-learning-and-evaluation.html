<p>This post contains some random remarks on ontology learning and evaluation:</p>
<ul>
<li>terms versus concepts: concepts are formed by grouping terms with the same meaning</li>
<li>collocation = co-occurrence of a <strong>sequence</strong> of words (significant phrase detection)</li>
<li>kinds of similarity:
(i) <em>paradigmatic similarity</em> -  terms are substitutable for each other in a given context (e.g. carrot and onion as different kinds of vegetables)
(ii) <em>syntagmatic similarity </em>- there is an association between the terms (relatedTo; e.g. "car" and "drive") which can be detected by statistical means (e.g. co-occurrence)</li></p>
<li>limited paradigmatic modifiability for detecting collocations (Wermter &amp; Hahn 2005)
<ul>
<li>easy to substitute words in a collocation candidate with other words (= high paradigmatic modifiability) => unlikely that the collocation is correct</li>
<li>limited modifiability => high probability that the collocation is correct</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></p>

<div>
<ul>
<li>task-based evaluation</li>
<li>corpus-based evaluation - compare ontology concepts with corpus concepts</li>
<li>criteria-based evaluation - based on criteria suggested by the domain experts (e.g. how many terms where aggregated to form a concept, interconnectivity, ...)</li>
</ul>
