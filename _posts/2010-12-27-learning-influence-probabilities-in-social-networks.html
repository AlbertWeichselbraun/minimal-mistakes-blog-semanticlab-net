<p>by Goyal et al. (goya2010)</p>
<p>The article's authors learn influence models based on</p>
<ul>
<li>social graphs and</li>
<li>an action log</li>
</ul>
Based on the learned models they are able to predict i) whether a user will perform a specific action and ii) when it will be performed.</p>
<p>A user's properties are encoded in a user influenceability and an action influence quotient.
According to the authors were Domingos and Richardson (domingos2001, richardson2002) the first to consider the propagation of influential users from a data mining perspective.</p>

</ul>
Tang et. al (tang2009) consider topic-specific influence analysis by identifying topic-specific subnetworks and influence weights. They discuss applying their  approach to the expert finding problem.</p>
