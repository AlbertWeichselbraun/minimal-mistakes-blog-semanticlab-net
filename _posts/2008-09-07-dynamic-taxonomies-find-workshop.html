<p>The term <i>dynamic taxonomies</i> refers to a multidimensional (multifaceted *check*) classification .</p>
<h2>Interesting ideas:</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>Searching/Browsing: express selections as queries; provide a <i>A-box</i> of the current selection, which acts as the base for further manipulations</li>
<li>DT-miner: computes co-occurrences using taxonomies yielding a higher (ontology dependent) abstraction level.
<pre>
    beer  -> beverages
    wine  -> beverages
    the   -> article
    chips -> snacks
  </pre>
  Possible ontologies: WordNet et. al</li>
<li>concepts are not terms; but the author uses a pragmatic approach and defines them as label for multidimensional classes.
<li>
<li>Term expansion: shallow vs. deep (see graphic); advantage: only consider the current part of the search space (shallow/deep)</li>
<li>related documents: establish a relationship between two documents if both of them share at least one common <i>classification</i>. => empirical evidence
  Application: e.g. the wine taxonomy</li></p>
<li>Searches: show a box with the domains of the first 20 search results; allow usage of these domains as filter criteria by (de)selection of single domains</li>
<li>Query extension: apply a reasoner to the T-Box to extend queries; serialize the reasoner's results to improve the process's performance.</li>
</ul></p>
<h2>Word Sense Disambiguation as the Primary Step of Ontology Integration</h2>
by Banek, Marko</p>
<ul>
<li>Idea: every class is expressed as WordNet synset tree
      => compare both trees 
      wordnet sense $$w_i$$ "most similar" to $$w_j$$ => meaning</li></p>
<li>Literature:
<ul>
<li>semantic similarity calculation for WordNet (Yank & Powers, 2005)</li>
<li>classic disambiguation techniques (Liu, Yu & Meng 2005)</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul></p>
