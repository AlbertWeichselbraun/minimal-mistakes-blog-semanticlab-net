<h2>Introduction</h2>
This article introduces HYENA-live a named entity recognition (NER) system which supports a fine-grained hierarchy and multi-labeling (e.g. a single named entity may be a manager,  a researcher and a person). Most state-of-the art tools only consider a small set of entity types such as Persons, Locations and Organizations.</p>
<p>The most common workaround for performing fine-grained NER is to deploy named entity linking (NEL) first and afterwards derive the entity's type from the knowledge base. Nevertheless, this approach has the following drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>NEL is an inherently hard problem, especially with ambiguous mentions.</li>
<li>NEL only works with mentions which are mentioned in the knowledge base and, therefore, heavily depends on the quality of the underlying knowledge base.</li>
</ol></p>
<h2>Method</h2>
HYENA creates its classification taxonomy from YAGO by organizing 100 descendant classes under the following five top level classes: <em>Person, Organization, Location, Event </em>and <em>Artifact. </em>The 100 descendant classes are picked based on the number of YAGO entities tagged with the class (i.e. the 100 most frequently used classes are selected).</p>
<p>HYENA then uses LIBLINEAR to train an SVM with the following features set:</p>
<ol>
<li>the <strong>mention</strong> string and uni-, bi- and trigrams overlapping with the mention string (i.e. "short name" variants)</li>
<li><strong>sentence level context</strong> information including information on whether an n-gram occurs <em>before</em> or <em>after</em> the mention (compare: prefixes and suffixes in Recognyze)</li>
<li><strong>paragraph level context</strong> which are features within a window size of 2000 characters before and after the mention to obtain <em>topical clues </em>(compare Recognyze context terms).</li>
<li><strong>grammatical features</strong> such as (i) <em>part-of-speech</em> tags,  (ii) the first occurrence of a <em>pronoun</em> (he/she) in the same sentence and in the subsequent sentence following the mention, and (iii) the closest <em>verb-preposition</em> pair preceding the mention.</li>
<li><strong>gazetteer features</strong> extracted from the YAGO knowledge base which contain type specific mentions (e.g. Alice for person, location, song and movie; Lainach for location, ...)</li>
