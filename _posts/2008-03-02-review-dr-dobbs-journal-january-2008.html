<p>The January issue covers the following interesting topics:</p>
<p><b>Tag Clouds</b>
Jurgen Appelo provides hints for optimizing the presentation of tag clouds by linearizing the data according to a Pareto distribution.
This technique could be useful for assigning the weight of labels in our ontologies.</p>
<p><b>Google Web Toolkit</b>
Ed Burnette and Adam Houghton present an example application using the <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit">Google Web Toolkit (GWT)</a> to provide a Flickr image service.</p>
<p><b>Creating a Web 2.0 application with PHP</b>
Andi Gutmans and Cal Evans present a graphical news feed service, extracting key words from news feeds and presenting flickr graphics related to the extracted terms.
The <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/content/V1/termExtraction.html">Yahoo Content Analyzer service</a> is facilitated for determining the relevant keywords.</p>
