<p>by Kent Beck and Cynthia Andres</p>
<p>I would like to point out some of the concepts and ideas presented in the book:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>small improvements</b>: analyse the corrent process, identify and implement improvements</li>
<li><b>incremental development</b>: create and implement small untis</li>
<li><b>Teams</b>: reduce a team's size, as its effectivity increases (!=add news tasks to <i>simulate</i> that everybody has enough to do)</li>
</ul></p>
