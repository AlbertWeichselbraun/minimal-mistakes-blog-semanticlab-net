<h2>Summary</h2></p>
<div>This article presents a case study from the domain of policy informatics - i.e. the field of finding effective ways to use information technology to understand and tackle complex problems of society - which describes how Web intelligence has been successfully applied to assess the public sentiment towards the U.S. immigration and border security.</div></p>
<div></div></p>
<h2>Method</h2></p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>a framework for collecting relevant Tweets from Twitter</li>
<li>sentiment analysis using <strong>eight emotional categories</strong> defined in Plutchik (1980): anger, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise, anticipation, joy and trust and the emotion lexicon developed by Mohammad &amp; Turney 2013.</li>
<li>social network analysis using different metrics such as m<em>ost followed users, most befriended users,</em> and betweenness<em> centrality  </em>for identifying key players</li>
<li>examination of differences in emotion and network between three major phases of the discussion using the Welch two sample t-test.</li>
</ol></p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2></p>
<ol>
<li>news often coincide with changes in public sentiment</li>
<li>Tweet posters and their relationships change considerably over time</li>
<li>different influence metrics yield significantly different rankings</li>
