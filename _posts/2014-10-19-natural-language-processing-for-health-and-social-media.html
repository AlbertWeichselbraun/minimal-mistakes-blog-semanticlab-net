<h2>Summary</h2>
In this article Mark Dredze and Michael J. Paul discuss the use of Twitter for collecting population data at a much <strong>lower cost</strong> <strong>than</strong> through traditional data sources such as <strong>surveys</strong>. One key challenge of mining health information from social media is extracting structured data from short and noisy unstructured text.</p>
<ol>
<li>the massive amounts of available data make it difficult to survey and explore the data.</li>
<li>keyword searches are problematic since users may miss important health topics</li>
<li>disambiguating tweets is challenging (for example, not all tweets containing flue-related keywords present actual infections).</li>
</ol></p>
<h2>Method</h2></p>
<ol>
<li>the authors use <em>topic models</em>, which represent documents as distributions of topics which in turn are formed by word distributions.</li>
<li><strong>evaluation: </strong>by measuring the ability of the models to capture real-world trends as measured by the US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).
<ul>
<li>tweets about cancer and serious illnesses per state are positively correlated with the rate of smokers in the corresponding state.</li>
<li>tweets on obesity are negatively correlated with the rate of exercise per US state.</li>
<li><em>control:</em> tweets on bacterial infections are unrelated to the rate of asthma in the US states.</li>
</ul>
</li></p>
<li>a supervised classifier was trained with more than 10,000 labeled tweets to identify tweets which reported influence infections using the following features
<ul>
<li>n-grams (phrases)</li>
<li>manually specified keyword groups (e.g. worried, scared, ...)</li>
<li>Twitter related features (URLs, hashtags, user mentions, emoticons)</li>
<li>linguistic features using part-of-speech tags (e.g. flu as a subject indicates <em>awareness</em> - "the flue is going around"; flue as an object indicates <em>infection</em> - "i finally got the flue")</li>
</ul>
<strong>evaluation: </strong>comparison with the infection rate measured by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</li>
