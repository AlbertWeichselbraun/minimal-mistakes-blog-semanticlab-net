<p>Krovetz, R. et al. 2011. The web is not a person, Berners-Lee is not an organization, and African-Americans are not locations: an analysis of the performance of named-entity recognition. Proceedings of the Workshop on Multiword Expressions: from Parsing and Generation to the Real World.</p>
<p>This paper presents an evaluation of named-entity recognition that is based on</p>
<ol>
<li>the agreement rate between three different NER-systems, and</li>
<li>the number of identified ambiguous entries (i.e. entities that were assigned to different NRE-classes (e.g. PERSON and ORGANIZATION) in the same document.</li>
</ol>
The authors show that although literature reports an accuracy of 85-95% for named entity  recognition the agreement rates between the classifiers and identified ambiguities suggest a much lower accuracy.</p>
<h2>Resources</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>NER taggers
<ul>
<li>Stanford tagger</li>
<li>LBJ tagger</li>
<li>IdentiFinder (proprietary)</li>
</ul>
</li></p>
<li>Language resources used for training
<ul>
<li>English Gigawords corpus</li>
<li>Reuters 1996 new corpus</li>
<li>North American News corpus</li>
</ul>
</li></p>
<li>Other language resources
<ul>
<li>ETS SourceFinder corpus</li>
<li>American national Corpus (ANC) - http://www.anc.org/annotations.html (tagged with NE)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></p>
<h2>Suggestions and Remarks</h2></p>
<ol>
<li>the authors hypothesize that it is unlikely for two ambiguous words (same word but different NE class) to appear in the same document.</li>
<li>they suggest to use grammar patterns such as "Bank of [LOCATION]" versus "[LOCATION]" to distinguish different NE classes.</li>
