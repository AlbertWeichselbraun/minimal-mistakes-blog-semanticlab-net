<p>by Fader et al.</p>
<p>This paper addresses two major shortcomings of state of the art open information extraction systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>uninformative extractions that omit critical information
"Faust made a deal with the devil" -> "Faust" - "made" - "deal"</li></p>
<li>incoherent extractions that yield phrase with no meaningful interpretation
"The guide contains dead links and omits sites" -> "contains omits"
"The Mark 14 was central to the torpedo scandal of the fleet" -> "was central torpedo"</li>
</ol>
The authors show that the use of <strong>syntactic </strong>and <strong>lexical constraints</strong> yield significant improvements in terms of precision.</p>
<p><strong>Important Definitions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>information extraction systems - learn an extractor per target relation and therefore do not scale to well</li>
<li>open information extraction - identify relational phrases by
<ul>
<li><strong>labeling</strong> sentences using heuristics or supervision</li>
<li><strong>learning</strong> phrases based on the training examples (TextRunner needs approximately 200,000 heuristically labeled sentences)</li>
<li><strong>extracting</strong> data based on the learned model</li>
</ul>
</li></p>
<li>light verb constructions (LVC) are multi-word expressions that are composed of a verb and a noun, with the noun carrying the semantic content of the predicate
<em>examples:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>is -> is an album my, is the author of, is a city in</li>
<li>has -> has a population of, has a Ph.D. in, ...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Applications of Open IE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>learning of selectional preferences (Ritter et al., 2010)</li>
<li>acquiring common sense knowledge (Lin et al., 2010)</li>
<li>recognizing entailment (Schoenmackers et al., 2010; Berant et al., 2011)</li>
<li>mapping onto existing ontologies (Soderland et al., 2010)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Syntactic constraints</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>require phrases to match POS tag patterns</li>
<li>multiple possible matches => the longest is chosen</li>
</ul>
<strong>Lexical constraints</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>prevent over-specified relation phrases such as "is offering only ...." by requiring phrases to appear multiple times in the corpus</li>
</ul>
<strong>Used evaluation metric</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Precision-Recall curve</li>
</ul></p>
