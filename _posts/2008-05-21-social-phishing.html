<p>This article covers various aspects of <i>phishing</i> attacks luring users into disclosing sensitive information, which (might) get abused by the phisher.</p>
<p>Modern flavors of phishing like <i>spear</i> or <i>context aware</i> phishing include context information about the victim's social environments into the phishing e-mail. Publicly available sources like FOAF, social network sites, blogs, etc. deliver the data for this kind of attack.</p>
<p>The authors of the study performed an experiment in their own campus, carefully considering federal laws and regulations in human subject research. The attack has been extremely successful (~70 % hit rate) and triggered a broad range of reactions like anger, denial, misunderstanding of the information e-mail, etc.
The experiment shows that most internet users underestimate the danger of publicly posted personal information and clearly overestimate the security and privacy of e-mail.</p>
