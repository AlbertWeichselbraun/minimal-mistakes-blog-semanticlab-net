<p>by Nan Li and Desheng Dash Wu (Decision Support Systems)</p>
<p>The authors combine the following five features to detect forum hotspots using either (i) K-means clustering or (ii) support vector machines:</p>
<ol>
<li>number of total topic posts (in every forum)</li>
<li>the average number of responses to these posts</li>
<li>the average forum sentiment (using a _simple_ bag of words approach)</li>
<li>the percentage of positive postings</li>
<li>the percentage of negative postings (which is in fact dependent on 4 ;)</li>
</ol>
They identify a cluster center for every forum and identify the sub-forums closest to this theoretical center as hotspots.</p>
